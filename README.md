# PSP-Emulation-N64

N64 emulator, only ROM for this one is Ocarina of Time for now!
More to follow at some point (yeah yeah, heard that before).

## Installation and Usage

Simply copy the Daedalusx64 folder (the one containing EBOOT.PBP) to /PSP/GAME on the PSP's memory stick.

ROMs for this emulator can be found in the 'N64 ROMS' folder. Copy whatever ROMs you want into the 'Roms' folder (inside 'Daedalusx64' folder) on the memory stick.
